## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Starting in HTML, creating a form, button and h2 and giving them classes / id's to reference later in css & js. From there a simple CSS file was formed including text and the most basic styling needs. In Javascript, I started by writing out the psuedocode to walk myself through the problem we were solving. Which was "How to convert celsius to fahrenheit". First, creating an event listener that would activate when the specified ID was clicked. Next, we needed to create a function that held the variable of temperature we were trying to calcuate. I didn't know the conversion off the top of my head, so I googled how to do the math on that, and added that to my variable for the converstion. Lastly, In order to read the new temperature out we connected the h2 in our html so that the new temperature would read out on the page! Afterwards, I went back in and adding a little additional styling in css to center it in the page and give it more padding between the elements.

I am sure there are better ways to describe what I did, but for now... this is where I am at in the articulation of my code - a true work in progress, yall.


## Lessons Learned:

In this first conversion, we were learning primarily about variables and functions. Which thankfully, so far has been one of the more smooth processes. However, learning to upload my work to GitHub was pretty challenging for me. I became frustrated at Git not working properly in my terminal and it has been days of me trying to figure out what's going on. The biggest lesson I learned through this process was to take a step back and just step away for a little bit when you can't get it to work.
